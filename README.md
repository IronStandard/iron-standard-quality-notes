# Iron Standard – PLA Filament Quality Notes

This repository documents internal quality principles used in the development of Iron Standard Filament.

## Purpose
This repository documents the general standards, assumptions, and decision criteria used when evaluating PLA filament intended for routine FDM printing.

It exists to describe expectations and acceptance thresholds, not to publish material formulations, suppliers, or proprietary processing details.

---

## Printing Context
The goal is predictable, repeatable behavior across common consumer and prosumer FDM printers using typical slicer settings and standard PLA temperature ranges.

Consistency across different machines is prioritized over tuning for a single optimized setup.

---

## What “Acceptable” PLA Means
For my use, PLA filament is considered acceptable when it:

- Prints predictably without frequent slicer changes  
- Maintains stable behavior throughout an entire spool  
- Does not require constant temperature or flow adjustment  
- Produces reliable layer adhesion for functional parts  

Repeatability is valued more than appearance-focused or marketing-driven metrics.

---

## Acceptance & Rejection Criteria
A filament may be rejected if normal use reveals:

- Noticeable print behavior changes without slicer changes  
- Inconsistent extrusion behavior across a single spool  
- Variability that forces repeated flow recalibration  
- Unreliable layer bonding at reasonable PLA temperatures  

Material that fails these criteria is not considered suitable for sale.

---

## Assumptions for First-Time and General Use
These standards assume use by typical FDM printer owners, including first-time filament users, with:

- Stock or lightly modified printers  
- Common brass nozzles  
- Default or manufacturer-recommended PLA slicer profiles  
- Normal cooling and bed adhesion methods  

The intent is acceptable filament behavior without requiring advanced tuning, experimental profiles, or printer-specific workarounds.

---

## Intended Audience
These standards are intended to support:

- First-time filament users  
- Hobbyists seeking consistent daily prints  
- Users who prefer default slicer profiles  
- Functional-print and small-shop workflows  

They are not intended for highly experimental or specialized printing scenarios.

---

## Non-Goals
These standards do not prioritize:

- Maximum print speed at the expense of consistency  
- Pushing temperature or flow limits beyond normal PLA use  
- Printer-specific tuning that does not generalize  
- Appearance-only optimizations that reduce repeatability  

The focus is predictable, everyday printing behavior.

---

## Change Philosophy
These standards are intentionally conservative and are expected to remain stable over time.

Updates are made only when they improve predictability or reduce user adjustment, not to chase incremental performance gains.

---

## Scope
This document applies specifically to PLA filament intended for standard FDM printing.

Other materials or specialty filaments may follow different evaluation criteria.

---

## Notes
These standards reflect practical, experience-based expectations developed through routine printing.

This repository intentionally avoids publishing formulations or process details and should be read as documentation of expectations, not performance guarantees.
